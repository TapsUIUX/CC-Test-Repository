# CC-Test-Repository
In this project the Angular application feeds on a Json file.<br>
It displays the data on the home page and allows to sort on the basis of the header clciked.<br>
It diplayes the formated data in formated-data tab.<br>
In explanation tab it explains the process of the whole app.<br>

It depend on bootstrap, ui-router, font-aweaome, angular js.<br><br>
